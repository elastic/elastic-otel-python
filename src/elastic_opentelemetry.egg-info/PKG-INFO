           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# nbtest

`nbtest` is Elastic's Search Labs testing and validation tool for Python
notebooks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install elastic-nbtest
```

## Usage

```bash
nbtest my-notebook.ipynb another-notebook.ipynb ...
```

## How it works

`nbtest` runs all the code cells in the notebook in order from top to bottom,
and reports two error situations:

- If any code cells raise an unexpected exception
- If any code cells that have output saved in the notebook generate a different
  output (not counting especially designated sections, as described in the
  "Configuration" section below)

Something to keep in mind when designing notebooks that are testable is that
for any operations that are asynchronous it is necessary to add code that
blocks until these operations complete, so that the entire notebook can
execute in batch mode without errors.

## Configuration

`nbtest` looks for a configuration file named `.nbtest.yml` in the same
directory as the target notebook. If the configuration file is found, it is
imported and applied for all the notebooks in that directory.

There is currently one supported configuration variable, called `masks`. This
variable can be set to a list of regular expresssions that capture details in
the output of code cells that vary from one run to the next and should be
masked when comparing the previously stored output against output from the
current run.

Here is an example `.nbtest.yml` file:

```yaml
masks:
- "'name': '[^']+'"
- "'cluster_name': '[^']+'"
- "'cluster_uuid': '[^']+'"
- "'build_flavor': '[^']+'"
- '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'
- "'build_hash': '[^']+'"
- "'build_date': '[^']+'"
```

## Handling of the `getpass` function

The `nbtest` script installs an alternative version of the `getpass()` function
that looks for requested values in environment variables instead of starting an
interactive prompt.

Consider the following example, which is used in many Elastic notebooks:

```python
CLOUD_ID = getpass("Elastic Cloud ID:")
ELASTIC_API_KEY = getpass("Elastic Api Key:")
```

The `getpass()` function used by `nbtest` takes the prompt given as an
argument and converts it to an environment variable name with the following
rules:

- Spaces are converted to underscores
- Non-alphanumeric characters are removed
- Letters are uppercased

In the above example, the variables that will be used to source these prompts
are `ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID` and `ELASTIC_API_KEY`.

As a convenience, `nbtest` imports all variables defined in a `.env` file if
found. The `--env-file` option can be used to provide an alternative
environment file.

## Set up and tear down procedures

Sometimes it is necessary to perform "set up" and/or "tear down" operations
before and after a notebook runs. `nbtest` will look for notebooks with special
names designated as set up or tear down and execute those notebooks to perform
any necessary actions.

### Set up notebooks

`nbtest` will look for the following notebooks names and execute any that are
found before running the target notebook:

- `_nbtest_setup.ipynb`
- `_nbtest_setup.[notebook-name].ipynb`

The first one can be used for general set up logic that applies to all the
notebooks in the directory. The `NBTEST["notebook"]` expression can be used
inside this notebook to obtain the name of the notebook under test.

The second one should be used for set up actions that are specific to one
notebook.

A global setup notebook can also be provided in the `--setup-notebook` command
line argument. This notebook is executed once, before any tests.

### Tear down notebooks

`nbtest` will look for the following notebooks names and execute any that are
found after running the target notebook, regardless of the testing having
succeeded or failed:

- `_nbtest_teardown.[notebook-name].ipynb`
- `_nbtest_teardown.ipynb`

These notebooks are inteded for cleanup that needs to happen after a text, for
example to delete indexes that were created. As in the set up case,
`NBTEST["notebook"]` is set to the notebook that was tested.

A global teardown notebook can also be provided in the `--teardown-notebook`
command line argument. This notebook is executed once, after all the tests.

## Mocking and/or Monkey-Patching

For specific cases in which it is necessary for tests to alter the behavior of
functions or methods, `nbtest` provides the `--mocks` option. The argument to
this option is a Python module name, exactly as it would be entered in an
`import` statement. The module will be imported in the context of the notebook
and any defined setup and teardown procedures.

The module passed to the `--mocks` option can apply any patching techniques as
needed by the tests. The following example patches the `Elasticsearch` class to
always connect to a locally hosted instance without authentication, regardless
of the connection arguments that are passed:

```python
import elasticsearch

orig_es_init = elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.__init__


def patched_es_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
    return orig_es_init(self, 'http://localhost:9200')


elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.__init__ = patched_es_init
```
