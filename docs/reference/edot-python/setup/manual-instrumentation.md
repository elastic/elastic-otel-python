# Manual instrumentation using the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry Python

Learn how to manually instrument Python applications using the {{edot}} Python SDK to add spans, metrics, and custom attributes. The following instructions require auto-instrumentation with OpenTelemetry to have been added to your application per [Setup](/reference/edot-python/setup/index.md).

## Configure EDOT Python

Refer to our [Setup](/reference/edot-python/setup/index.md) page for more details.

## Manually instrument your auto-instrumented Python application

The following example shows how to add manual instrumentation to an already automatically instrumented application. A use case for this setup would be to trace something in particular while keeping the benefits of the simplicity of the automatic instrumentation doing the hard work for you.

As an example we'll use an application using the Flask framework that implements an endpoint mounted on `/hello` returning a friendly salute. This application is saved in a file named `app.py` that is the default module for Flask applications.

```python
import random

from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    choices = ["there", "world", "folks", "hello"]
    # create a span for the choice of the name, this may be a costly call in your real world application
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("choice") as span:
        choice = random.choice(choices)
        span.set_attribute("choice.value", choice)
    return f"Hello {choice}!"
```

Make sure to have Flask and the Flask OpenTelemetry instrumentation installed:

```bash
pip install flask
edot-bootstrap --action=install
```

Then run this application with the following command:

```bash
opentelemetry-instrument flask run
```

You might not only need to add a custom span to our application but also want to use a custom metric, like in the next example, where you are tracking how many times we are getting one of the possible choices for our salutes:

```python
import random

from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import metrics, trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)

hello_counter = meter.create_counter(
    "hello.choice",
    description="The number of times a salute is chosen",
)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    choices = ["there", "world", "folks", "hello"]
    # create a span for the choice of the name, this may be a costly call in your real world application
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("choice") as span:
        choice = random.choice(choices)
        span.set_attribute("choice.value", choice)
    hello_counter.add(1, {"choice.value": choice})
    return f"Hello {choice}!"
```

## Confirm that EDOT Python is working

To confirm that EDOT Python has successfully connected to Elastic:

1. Go to **Observability** → **Applications** → **Service Inventory**
1. Find the name of the service to which you just added EDOT Python. It can take several minutes after initializing EDOT Python for the service to show up in this list.
1. Select the name in the list to see trace data.

:::{note}
There might be no trace data to visualize unless you have used your application since initializing EDOT Python.
