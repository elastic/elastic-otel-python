# Instrumenting Python applications with EDOT SDKs on Kubernetes

Learn how to instrument Python applications on Kubernetes using the OpenTelemetry Operator, the {{edot}} (EDOT) Collector, and the EDOT Python SDK.

- For general knowledge about the EDOT Python SDK, refer to the [EDOT Java Intro page](/reference/edot-python/index.md).
- For Python auto-instrumentation specifics, refer to [OpenTelemetry Operator Python auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#python).
- To manually instrument your Python application code (by customizing spans and metrics), refer to [EDOT Python manual instrumentation](/reference/edot-python/setup/manual-instrumentation.md).
- For general information about instrumenting applications on Kubernetes, refer to [instrumenting applications on Kubernetes](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/instrumenting-applications.md).

## Supported environments and configuration

The following environments and configurations are supported:

- EDOT Python container image supports `glibc` and `musl` based auto-instrumentation for Python 3.12.
- `musl` based containers instrumentation requires an [extra annotation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#annotations-python-musl) and operator v0.113.0+.
- To turn on logs auto-instrumentation, refer to [auto-instrument python logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#auto-instrumenting-python-logs).
- To turn on specific instrumentation libraries, refer to [excluding auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#python-excluding-auto-instrumentation).
- For a full list of configuration options, refer to [Python specific configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/python/configuration/#python-specific-configuration).
- For Python specific limitations when using the OpenTelemetry operator, refer to [Python-specific topics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/python/operator/#python-specific-topics).

## Instrument a Python app on Kubernetes

Following this example, you can learn how to:

- Turn on auto-instrumentation of a Python application using one of the following supported methods:
  - Adding an annotation to the deployment Pods.
  - Adding an annotation to the namespace.
- Verify that auto-instrumentation libraries are injected and configured correctly.
- Confirm data is flowing to **{{kib}} Observability**.

For this example, we assume the application you're instrumenting is a deployment named `python-app` running in the `python-ns` namespace.

1. Ensure you have successfully [installed the OpenTelemetry Operator](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/deployment.md), and confirm that the following `Instrumentation` object exists in the system:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get instrumentation -n opentelemetry-operator-system
    NAME                      AGE    ENDPOINT
    elastic-instrumentation   107s   http://opentelemetry-kube-stack-daemon-collector.opentelemetry-operator-system.svc.cluster.local:4318
    ```

    :::{note}
    If your `Instrumentation` object has a different name or is created in a different namespace, you will have to adapt the annotation value in the next step.
    :::

2. Turn on auto-instrumentation of the Python application using one of the following methods:

    - Edit your application workload definition and include the annotation under `spec.template.metadata.annotations`:

        ```yaml
        spec:
        # ...
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: python-app
            annotations:
                instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: opentelemetry-operator-system/elastic-instrumentation
        # ...
        ```

    - Alternatively, add the annotation at namespace level to apply auto-instrumentation in all Pods of the namespace:

        ```bash
        kubectl annotate namespace python-ns instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python=opentelemetry-operator-system/elastic-instrumentation
        ```

3. Restart the application:

    After the annotation has been set, restart the application to create new Pods and inject the instrumentation libraries:

        ```bash
        kubectl rollout restart deployment python-app -n python-ns
        ```

4. Verify the [auto-instrumentation resources](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/instrumenting-applications.md#how-auto-instrumentation-works) are injected in the Pod:

    Run a `kubectl describe` of one of your application pods and check:

    - There should be an init container named `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python` in the Pod:

        ```bash
        $ kubectl describe pod python-app-8d84c47b8-8h5z2 -n python-ns
        ...
        ...
        Init Containers:
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python:
            Container ID:  containerd://fdc86b3191e34ef5ec872853b14a950d0af1e36b0bc207f3d59bd50dd3caafe9
            Image:         docker.elastic.co/observability/elastic-otel-python:0.3.0
            Image ID:      docker.elastic.co/observability/elastic-otel-python@sha256:de7b5cce7514a10081a00820a05097931190567ec6e18a384ff7c148bad0695e
            Port:          <none>
            Host Port:     <none>
            Command:
            cp
            -r
            /autoinstrumentation/.
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-python
            State:          Terminated
            Reason:       Completed
        ...
        ```

    - The main container has new environment variables, including `PYTHONPATH`:

        ```bash
        ...
        Containers:
        python-app:
        ...
            Environment:
        ...
            PYTHONPATH:                          /otel-auto-instrumentation-python/opentelemetry/instrumentation/auto_instrumentation:/otel-auto-instrumentation-python
            OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL:         http/protobuf
            OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER:                otlp
            OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER:               otlp
            OTEL_SERVICE_NAME:                   python-app
            OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT:         http://opentelemetry-kube-stack-daemon-collector.opentelemetry-operator-system.svc.cluster.local:4318
        ...
        ```

    - The Pod has an `EmptyDir` volume named `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python` mounted in both the main and the init containers in path `/otel-auto-instrumentation-python`:

        ```bash
        Init Containers:
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python:
        ...
            Mounts:
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-python from opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python (rw)
        Containers:
        python-app:
        ...
            Mounts:
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-python from opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python (rw)
        ...
        Volumes:
        ...
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python:
            Type:        EmptyDir (a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime)
        ```

    Make sure the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` points to a valid endpoint and there's network communication between the Pod and the endpoint.

5. Confirm data is flowing to **{{kib}}**:

    - Open **Observability** → **Applications** → **Service inventory**, and determine if:
        - The application appears in the list of services.
        - The application shows transactions and metrics.
        - If [python logs instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#auto-instrumenting-python-logs) is enabled, the application logs should  appear in the Logs tab.

    - For application container logs, open **{{kib}} Discover** and filter for your Pods' logs. In the provided example, we could filter for them with either of the following:
        - `k8s.deployment.name: "python-app"` (adapt the query filter to your use case)
        - `k8s.pod.name: python-app*` (adapt the query filter to your use case)

    Note that the container logs are not provided by the instrumentation library, but by the DaemonSet collector deployed as part of the [operator installation](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/deployment.md).
