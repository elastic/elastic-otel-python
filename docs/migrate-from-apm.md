# Get started

This guide will highlight the major differences between APM Python Agent and the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry Python (EDOT Python).
For an hands-on approach on setting up EDOT Python refer to the [Get started guide](./get-started.md).

## We are a distribution

EDOT Python being a distribution of OpenTelemetry means we should follow standards and can't always drift from that. That does not mean there isn't still space for innovation.

## Bold on autoinstrumentation

We have chosen to make auto-instrumentation as simple as possible so you can just focus on your code; we favored an experience that requires minimal changes to your application code. The upstream OpenTelemetry configuration has more options and configuration knobs than the distribution requires setting.

## Bring your own instrumentation

In EDOT Python we decided to not ship all the available instrumentations in order to accomodate environments where installing more packages than requested may be an issue.
We provide a tool to discover available instrumentations automatically that can be added to your build workflow. See [Get started](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-otel-python/blob/main/docs/get-started.md#install-the-available-instrumentation).

## Limitations

### Central configuration

At the moment we don't have a Central configuration feature so all the configurations are static and should be provided to the application with other configurations.

### AWS lambda

At the moment, we are not building a custom lambda layer for our Python distribution. You can refer to the upstream [Lambda Auto-Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/faas/lambda-auto-instrument/).

### Missing instrumentations

Not all instrumentation we have in APM Python Agent have an OpenTelemetry counterpart, we may port them if there is customer request.

At the moment of writing the following libraries are missing an OpenTelemetry instrumentation:
- aiobotocore
- aiomysql
- aiopg
- aioredis
- Azure storage and Azure queue
- Graphene
- httplib2
- pylibmc
- pyodbc
- pymssql
- Sanic
- zlib

## Next steps

* [Get started](./get-started.md) with EDOT Python.
* Learn how to add [manual instrumentation](./manual-instrumentation.md).
* Learn more about viewing and interpreting data in the [Observability guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm.html).
